def compute_income_segregation(df, cbg_gdf):
    """
    For each POI (i.e. each row in df), compute an income segregation score
    based on the processed visitor counts.
    
    The function maps each CBG (key in the processed dict) to an income quartile
    (using cbg_income_map, which should map CBG (as int) to a quartile in {1,2,3,4}),
    sums the visitor counts by quartile, and then calculates the segregation
    measure as:
    
         segregation = (2/3) * sum(|proportion - 0.25|)
    
    where the proportion is the fraction of visitors from each quartile.
    
    Parameters:
      df             : DataFrame that now includes 'processed_visitor_home_cbgs'
      cbg_income_map : Dictionary mapping CBG (as int) to income quartile (1-4)
